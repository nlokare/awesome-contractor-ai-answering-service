# Awesome Contractor AI Answering Service [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of AI answering services, virtual receptionists, intake-script tooling, and triage resources for home-service contractors (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, garage door, and adjacent trades).

This list exists because the public landscape of contractor-fit AI phone tools changes monthly and there is no single place to evaluate the category. Every entry below is listed with a one-line factual description, a pricing-model tag, and a primary-source link to the vendor's published pricing page (where one exists).

Maintained by [OnCrew](https://oncrew.ai). Vendor-neutral by policy: OnCrew is one entry in the named-vendor section below alongside every competitor. The free 60-question intake checklist and the JSON API at the bottom are CC-BY-4.0 so any vendor (including OnCrew's competitors) can use them to evaluate themselves.

PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](#contributing).

AI receptionists where the contractor writes the trade-specific intake script themselves.
